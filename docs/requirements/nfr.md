    loyalty, and adoption of the system.

**Metrics**: User satisfaction ratings, Net Promoter Score (NPS), Task
completion time, Error rate, User feedback

## **Maintainability Requirements**

### Modularity

-   The system should be designed in a modular way, with well-defined
    components and interfaces, to facilitate updates, maintenance, and
    future enhancements.

-   Modularity improves the system\'s maintainability, reduces
    development time, and minimizes the risk of unintended side effects
    when making changes.

**Metrics**: Number of modules, Coupling between modules, Cohesion
within modules, Time required for updates and maintenance

### Extensibility

-   The system should be designed to accommodate future enhancements and
    integrations without significant modifications to the core codebase.

-   Extensibility ensures that the system can adapt to changing
    requirements and integrate with other systems without major
    disruptions.

**Metrics**: Number of extensions or integrations, Time required to
implement new features or integrations, Impact of changes on the core
system

### Documentation

-   The system should be accompanied by comprehensive and up-to-date
    documentation, including user guides, administrator manuals, and
    developer documentation.

-   Clear and accurate documentation is essential for users,
    administrators, and developers to understand, operate, and maintain
    the system effectively.

**Metrics**: Completeness of documentation, Accuracy of documentation,
Timeliness of documentation updates

## **Portability Requirement**

### Deployment Flexibility

-   The system should be deployable on a variety of platforms and
    environments, including cloud, on-premises, and hybrid deployments.
